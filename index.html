        <p>
          Here at STEM Egypt Hack Club, we are building a community of student makers and coders. Together, we utilize our expertise to build each other up to become better makers and hackers as a whole! Our aim is to give you the means and the knowledge to create any tech project you can think up. We will teach you how to build quirky, unique projects: video games, python simulations and programs, mobile applications, web applications, and more! Everyone who attends our sessions is welcome to participate and learn something new and interesting for <i>free</i>! Don't worry if you are new to programming; our seminars are highly beginner-friendly, and we are here to assist you at every step along the journey.
          <i>

        <h1 class="welcome">What's a Hacker?</h1>
        <p>
          A hacker is not always someone who trespasses on banks or plunders a friend's V-Bucks. Hackers are individuals who identify problems that need to be solved and devise the most practical-efficient solutions. These issues frequently call for an inventive mentality, technological know-how, and exposure to new ideas. Many can be solved with computers or clever engineering. At STEM Egypt Hack Club, we want our hackers to be creative problem solvers who are also proficient in coding, engineering, and problem-solving.
          <br/><br/>
          Coding and computer science not only apply to specific problems - it fundamentally teaches how to solve complex problems using step-by-step logic. Coding teaches you how to dissect the issues and find solutions, so knowing it is valuable regardless of the job you end up choosing. STEM Egypt Hack Club cards are mainly focused on coding and engineering, including building unique-new software projects, protecting the community's network, conducting research projects and articles and much more!
